# Leukocyte Classification Project

This project was developed as part of the **Computer Vision** course during the first semester of the Erasmus Mundus Master’s in Sustainable Systems Engineering at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC).

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to design and evaluate a computer vision pipeline for leukocyte (white blood cell) classification using supervised learning techniques. The workflow follows a structured machine learning approach, including data preparation, model training, and performance evaluation.

## 🗂 Project Structure

The project is organised into three main stages:

1. **Data Preparation** (`01_data_preparation_leukocytes.ipynb`)

   * Dataset loading and preprocessing
   * Image normalization and resizing
   * Data augmentation
   * Train/validation/test split

2. **Model Training** (`02_model_training_leukocytes.ipynb`)

   * Implementation of deep learning models for image classification
   * Hyperparameter configuration
   * Training and optimisation

3. **Model Evaluation** (`03_model_evaluation_leyko.ipynb`)

   * Performance metrics computation
   * Confusion matrix analysis
   * Accuracy and classification assessment

## 🧠 Methodology

The project applies computer vision and deep learning techniques to automatically classify leukocyte images. The pipeline emphasises reproducibility, structured experimentation, and quantitative performance evaluation.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Practical implementation of image classification models
* Understanding of data preprocessing for medical imaging
* Model training and hyperparameter tuning
* Performance evaluation using standard classification metrics
